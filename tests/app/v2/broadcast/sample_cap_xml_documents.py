            <description>A severe flood warning has been issued. Storm Dennis has resulted in significant rainfall in the Steeping River catchment with several bands of heavy rain passing through the area during today (Sunday 16 Feb). River levels along the Steeping River and the Wainfleet relief channel are expected to be similar to those in June 2019. This could result in flood embankments being overtopped. Should this happen, there is an increased risk that flood embankments could breach. It is expected that peak levels along the Steeping River in Wainfleet will be between midnight and 3am tonight. A multi-agency meeting is taking place this evening. Further messages will be issued should this be required. Do not walk on flood embankments and avoid riverside paths. Our staff are out in the area to check the flood defences and assist the emergency services and council. We will be closely monitoring the situation throughout the night. </description>
            <instruction># To check the latest information for your area - Visit [GOV.UK](https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk) to see the current flood warnings, view river and sea levels or check the 5-day flood risk forecast: https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk - Follow [@EnvAgency](https://twitter.com/EnvAgency) and [#floodaware](https://twitter.com/hashtag/floodaware) on Twitter. - Tune into weather, news and travel bulletins on local television and radio. - For access to flood warning information offline call Floodline on 0345 988 1188 using quickdial code: 307052. # What you should consider doing now - Call 999 if you are in immediate danger. - Co-operate with the emergency services and evacuate your property if told to do so. Most evacuation centres will let you bring your pets. - Act on your flood plan if you have one. - Move your family and pets to a safe place with a means of escape. - Use flood protection equipment (such as flood barriers, air brick covers and pumps) to protect your property. Unless you have proper equipment do not waste valuable time trying to keep the water out. - Move important items upstairs or to a safe place in your property, starting with cherished items of personal value that you will not be able to replace (such as family photographs). Next move valuables (such as computers), movable furniture and furnishings. - You may need to leave your property, so pack a bag with enough items for a few nights away. Include essential items including a torch with spare batteries, mobile phone and charger, warm clothes, home insurance information, water, food, first aid kit and any prescription medicines or baby care items you may need. - Turn off gas, electricity and water mains supplies before flood water starts to enter your property. Never touch an electrical switch if you are standing in water. - If it is safe to do so, make sure neighbours are aware of the situation and offer help to anyone who may need it. - Avoid walking, cycling or driving through flood water - 30 cm of fast-flowing water can move a car and 6 inches can knock an adult off their feet. - Flood water is dangerous and may be polluted. Wash your hands thoroughly if youâ€™ve been in contact with it. ##### Businesses - Act on your business flood plan if you have one. - Move your staff and customers to a safe place with a means of escape. - Move stock and other valuable items upstairs or to a safe place in your building.
