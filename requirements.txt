# Kombu is a library that celery uses under the hood.
# Kombu v4.0.2 (which ships with celery v4.0.2) doesn't work with SQS due to problems with their use of boto2, so
# Kombu migrated to boto3 - We're waiting for that to get a release version, and then to get a new version of celery
# that pulls that in. Until that point, we should override the kombu version to get these SQS fixes.
# Additionally, kombu master also includes a fix for the main process taking 100% CPU and not distributing tasks (!)
# See https://github.com/celery/kombu/pull/693 and https://github.com/celery/kombu/pull/760
